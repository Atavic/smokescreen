A JavaScript program that constantly opens random sites from a list to make a "smokescreen" over your browser history.

## What is it?
Smokescreen is a simple JavaScript program that randomly opens sites from a long list of popular URLs from many categories. This will act as a mask, or "smokescreen" over your browsing history, to troll, confuse, and confound the prying eyes of those who may be spying on your browser history.
### Why?
In 2017, the US president signed a bill that would allow ISPs to obtain access to your browser history and sell it to whoever they please. This could mean government agencies, large advertisement businesses, or if they really wanted to, your creepy neighbor next-door. This will make it more difficult for your ISPs to find or sell real history to others, thus preventing your information from being compromised.
